h1. Locomotive CMS

Locomotive is a simple but powerful CMS based on liquid templates and mongodb database. If we have to give only 4 main features to describe our application, there will be:

* managing as many websites as you want with one application instance
* nice looking UI (see http://www.locomotiveapp.org for some screenshots)
* flexible content types
* inline editing

h2. Strategy / Development status

We already developed a fully functional prototype in Rails 2.3.2 with both active record / mongomapper and it worked quite well. We are even using it for some client websites.
Now, our goal is to port our prototype to Rails 3 and migrate from mongomapper to mongoid. Besides, we put a lot of efforts to make it as robust as we can by writing better specs than we wrote for the prototype at first.
