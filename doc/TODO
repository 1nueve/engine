BOARD:  
- theme assets
- theme assets picker (???)

BACKLOG:
- file type (icons)

- devise messages in French
- localize devise emails
- refactoring admin crud (pages + layouts + snippets)
- refactoring page.rb => create module pagetree

- refactoring: CustomFields::CustomField => CustomFields::Field
- optimization custom_fields: use dynamic class for a collection instead of modifying the metaclass each time we build an item

BUGS:
- theme assets: disable version if not image
- assets uploader: remove old files if new one

NICE TO HAVE:
- asset collections: custom resizing if image
