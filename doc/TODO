BOARD:  

- refactor slugify method (use parameterize + create a module)
- send email when new content added thru api
- templatized: do not display content with visible / active set to false
    
BACKLOG:

- rack app to map pretty asset url to S3
- notify accounts when new instance of models (opt): none, one or many accounts. Used for contact form.
- theme assets: disable version if not image
- new custom field types:
  - belongs_to => association
- cucumber features for admin pages
- validation for custom fields
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)

BUGS:

- custom fields: accepts_nested_attributes weird behaviour when creating new content type + adding random fields

NICE TO HAVE:
- asset collections: custom resizing if image
- super_finder
- better icons for mime type
- traffic statistics
- Worker => Heroku / S3 (not so sure finally)
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- page redirection (option)
