BOARD:

x page with regexp url => wildcards
- with_scope allowed for the find tag
- nested relationships (find tag)
- script to migrate from templatized to wildcard
- seo title (content_entry should be available)
- write more tests
  - find_spec
  - features
- clean code

BACKLOG:

- custom_fields:
  - validation: regexp (pre-defined regexps ?)
  x new type: belongs_to => association
- inline editing (http://www.aloha-editor.com/wiki/index.php/Aloha_PHP_Example)
  - html view in the aloha popup
  - editable elements should wrap a tag: div, h1, ...etc (default span)
  - edit images (upload new ones, ...etc) => wait for aloha or send them an email ?
- upgrade warning if new version of locomotive (maybe based on the commit id)
- deploying workflow:
  - roll back a bad update
  - conflicts with content types
  - dev -> staging -> production
  - sync data
  - import only theme assets
- endless pagination

- tooltip to explain the difference between 1.) Admin 2.) Author 3.) Designer?
- [bushido] guiders / welcome page / devise cas authentication (SSO)

NICE TO HAVE:
- export site
- super_finder
- traffic statistics
- asset picker (content instance)
- page with regexp url ?
- automatic update !
- page not found (front) => if logged in, link to create the page
- switch to list (theme assets / assets ?). delete all in once (with checkbox) or see details (updated_at, size, ...etc)
- code completion ? http://blog.quplo.com/2010/06/common-sense-code-completion/
